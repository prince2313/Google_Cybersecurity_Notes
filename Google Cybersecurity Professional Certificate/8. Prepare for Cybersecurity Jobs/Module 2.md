## Incident Escalation
### Incident Escalation

- Structured process of identifying and transferring potential security threats.
- Ensures issues are handled by experienced personnel.
- Security analysts must recognize and report potential incidents.
- Examples:
  - Employee repeatedly entering incorrect login credentials.
- Each organization has specific protocols.

### Notification of Breaches

- Understanding breach notification laws is critical.
- Many countries require notification of security breaches involving PII.
  - PII includes Social Security numbers, medical records, addresses, etc.
- Laws are regularly updated; staying informed is necessary.

### Low-Level Security Issues

- Do not involve PII exposure but still pose risks.
- Examples:
  - Single failed login attempt.
  - Downloading unapproved software.
- Investigation is necessary to mitigate potential impacts.
- Multiple failed login attempts could indicate malicious activity.
- Unauthorized software can introduce malware, leading to financial and reputational damage.

### The Escalation Process

- Each company has unique escalation protocols.
- Protocols detail:
  - Steps for notifying the appropriate personnel.
  - Methods for escalating incidents (IT desk, incident management tool, direct communication).
- Knowing and following these protocols ensures efficient incident management.

### Key Takeaways

- Incident escalation is vital for protecting organizational data.
- Security analysts must understand specific escalation protocols.
- Both minor and major security issues should be reported to the right team members.
- Proactive approach minimizes risks and enhances overall security posture.

### Data Controllers

- Determine the procedure and purpose for processing data.
- Focus on collecting personal information of customers.
- Ensure data is used, stored, and processed according to security and privacy regulations.
- Example: Escalation of risks to sensitive customer information to data controllers.

### Data Processors

- Report to data controllers and process data on their behalf.
- Typically vendors responsible for installing security measures to protect data.
- Example: Escalation of data processing issues to the overseer of the third-party organization responsible for data processing.

### Data Custodians

- Assign and remove access to software or hardware.
- Implement security controls, grant and revoke access, create storage and transmission policies, advise on threats, and monitor data.
- Example: Notified when data security controls need strengthening or have been compromised.

### Data Protection Officers (DPOs)

- Monitor internal compliance with data protection procedures.
- Advise the security team on obligations required by data protection standards and procedures.
- Conduct assessments to determine the effectiveness of security measures.
- Example: Notified when standards or protocols have been violated.

### Key Takeaways

- Incident escalation involves various security team members working together.
- Entry-level analysts should be familiar with different roles and responsibilities.
