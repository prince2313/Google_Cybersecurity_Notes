- Subnetting is the subdivision of a network into logical groups called subnets.
- It divides up a network address range into smaller subnets based on IP addresses and network masks.
- Subnetting creates a network of devices to function as their own network, improving efficiency and enabling the creation of security zones.

### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Notation for Subnetting

- CIDR is a method of assigning subnet masks to IP addresses to create subnets.
- It replaced classful addressing, expanding the number of available IPv4 addresses.
- CIDR IP addresses are formatted like IPv4 addresses but include a slash ("/") followed by a number indicating the IP network prefix.
- CIDR addressing reduces routing table entries and provides more available IP addresses within networks.
- You can try converting CIDR to IPv4 addresses and vice versa through an online conversion tool, like [IPAddressGuide](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr), for practice and better understanding.

### Security Benefits of Subnetting

- Subnetting allows organizations to create smaller networks within their private network without requesting additional IP addresses from ISPs.
- It uses network bandwidth more efficiently and improves network performance.
- Subnetting is a component of creating isolated subnetworks through physical isolation, routing configuration, and firewalls.

### Key Takeaways

- Subnetting is a common security strategy used by organizations to improve network efficiency and create security zones within their networks.
