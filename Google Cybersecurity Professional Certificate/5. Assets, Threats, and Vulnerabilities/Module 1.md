# Introduction to asset security
## Understand Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

### Key Definitions

- **Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
### Security Risk

- Security plans focus on defining risk.
- Definition of risk varies by organization.
- **Risk Calculation**: Likelihood x Impact = Risk.
  - Example: Driving to work and risking being late due to a flat tire.
#### Importance of Calculating Risk

- Prevent costly and disruptive events.
- Identify improvements for systems and processes.
- Determine tolerable risks.

## Common Classification Requirements
### Why Asset Management Matters

- Asset management involves tracking assets and associated risks.
- Importance: Protect what you know you have.
- Essential for businesses to operate smoothly by ensuring assets are secure and available.
- Example: Banks need to secure money and ensure availability.
### Asset Inventory

- **Asset inventory**: A comprehensive listing of all assets in an organization, including details about ownership, location, and classification.
### Types of Assets

- **Digital assets**: Customer data, financial records.
- **Information systems**: Networks, software.
- **Physical assets**: Facilities, equipment, supplies.
- **Intangible assets**: Brand reputation, intellectual property.
### Purpose of Asset Classification

- Labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance.
- Helps determine:
  - What you have.
  - Where it is.
  - Who owns it.
  - How important it is.
### Benefits of Asset Classification

- Implement effective risk management strategies.
- Prioritize security resources.
- Reduce IT costs.
- Ensure compliance with legal regulations.
### Common Asset Classifications

- **Restricted**: Highest level, for incredibly sensitive assets (e.g., need-to-know information).
- **Confidential**: Assets whose disclosure can cause significant negative impact.
- **Internal-only**: Assets available to employees and business partners.
- **Public**: Lowest level, no negative consequences if released.
### Application of Classification Scheme

- Depends on asset characteristics.
- Ownership can be complicated to determine, especially for information.
### Challenges of Classifying Information

- Identifying the owner is straightforward for tangible assets but tricky for information.
- Example: Company-issued laptop used for personal matters.
- Information can have multiple classification values simultaneously.
  - Example: A letter with public (name) and confidential (address) information.
### Key Takeaways

- Every business has unique requirements for their security strategy.
- Understanding asset classification helps in protecting information.
- Recognizing classification challenges is essential for solving security needs.

	- In use
	- In transit
	- At rest

- **Data in use:**
	- Data being accessed by one or more users.

- **Data in transit:**
	- Data traveling from one point to another.

- **Data at rest:**
	- Data not currently being accessed.

- **Information security (InfoSec):**
	- The practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

## The Emergence of Cloud Security
### Soaring into the Cloud

- Cloud computing defined by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre as “An on-demand, massively scalable service, hosted on shared infrastructure, accessible via the internet.”
- Businesses are increasingly moving data to the cloud, introducing new cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.
### Cloud-Based Services

- Refers to a variety of on-demand or web-based business solutions, including website hosting, application development environments, and back-end infrastructure.
- Three main categories:
  - **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Front-end applications accessed via a web browser (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Zoom).
  - **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Back-end application development tools accessed online (e.g., Google App Engine, Heroku, VMware Cloud Foundry).
  - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Remote access to back-end systems (e.g., data processing servers, storage, networking resources).
### Major Cloud Service Providers

- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure
### Cloud Security

- Focuses on protecting data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Clients secure what is directly within their control (identity and access management, resource configuration, data handling). The amount of responsibility varies by service type (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS).
### Cloud Security Challenges

- **Misconfiguration**: Customers often use default configurations that don't meet their specific security needs.
  - Leads to cloud-native breaches.
- **Monitoring Access**: Can be difficult depending on the client and service level.
- **Regulatory Standards**: Meeting requirements like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR is challenging.
- Growing need for cloud security professionals due to increasing risks.
### Key Takeaways

- The global marketplace is shifting to cloud-based services, introducing new security models and challenges.
- Familiarity with cloud services is crucial for supporting organizational efforts to protect information online.
### Resources for More Information

- [The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/understanding-cloud-services/cloud-security-shared-responsibility-model) has a detailed guide for choosing, using, and deploying cloud services securely based on the shared responsibility model.
- [The Cloud Security Alliance®](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/) is an organization dedicated to creating secure cloud environments. They offer access to cloud security-specific research, certification, and products to users with a paid membership.
