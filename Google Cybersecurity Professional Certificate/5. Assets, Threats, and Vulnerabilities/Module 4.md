## Social Engineering Tactics

### Social Engineering Risks

- **Social engineering**: Manipulation technique exploiting human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
- Exploits natural feelings of curiosity, generosity, and excitement.
- Example: [_Twitter Hack of 2020_](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/Twitter_Report) - Hackers tricked Twitter employees via phone calls, gained access to the network, and took over high-profile accounts.
- Serious risks because attacks don't require sophisticated computer skills.
- Defending requires a multi-layered approach combining technological controls and user awareness.

#### Signs of an Attack

Common types of social engineering attacks:

- **Baiting**: Tempts people into compromising security (e.g., infected USB drives).
- **Phishing**: Uses digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
- **Quid pro quo**: Tricking someone into believing they’ll be rewarded for sharing access, information, or money (e.g., impersonating a loan officer).
- **Tailgating**: Unauthorized people following an authorized person into a restricted area (also called piggybacking).
- **Watering hole**: Compromising a website frequently visited by a specific group of users (e.g., _Holy Water attack of 2020_).

### Encouraging Caution

Three main areas to focus on in security training:

- **Stay alert**: Watch for suspicious communications and unknown people (e.g., look for spelling errors, double-check sender's name and email address).
- **Be cautious**: Avoid sharing information over social media.
- **Control curiosity**: Be wary of things that seem too good to be true (e.g., attachments or links in emails and advertisements).

**Pro tip:** Implement technologies like firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), block lists, and email filtering to layer defenses.

- Security training should extend to customers.
- Security analysts play a role in promoting safe practices (e.g., testing systems, documenting best practices).

### Key Takeaways

- Social engineering exploits people's willingness to help and their trusting nature.
- Criminals use various manipulation techniques to trick targets.
- Implementing effective controls and recognizing attack signs are crucial for preventing threats.

## Prevent injection attacks

### Introduction

- SQL is a widely-used language for interacting with databases.
- SQL injection is a common attack vector aimed at manipulating databases.
- Attackers exploit SQL vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to web applications.

### SQL queries

- Data in databases is organized in tables.
- SQL queries retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from tables.
- Injection points often exist in user input fields like login forms or search bars.

### SQL injection categories
#### In-band SQL injection

- Most common type, uses the same communication channel.
- Attack results are retrieved through the same channel used for injection.

#### Out-of-band SQL injection

- Uses a different communication channel for attack and results.
- Less common due to server feature dependencies.

#### Inferential SQL injection

- Attacker infers results by analyzing system behavior.
- Can deduce database structure and execute subsequent attacks.

### Injection Prevention

- **Prepared statements**:
  - Execute SQL statements before passing them to the database.
- **Input sanitization**:
  - Remove or escape characters that could be interpreted as code.
- **Input validation**:
  - Ensure user input meets system expectations.

### Additional Resources

- [OWASP's SQL injection detection techniques](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/05-Testing_for_SQL_Injection)

### Key takeaways

- SQL injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in user input fields.
- Collaborate with developers to implement prevention techniques effectively.
