# Introduction to Python
## Get to Know Python
### How Programming Works

- **Programming**: Process of creating a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
- Programs are everywhere: computers, cell phones, electronic devices.
- Multiple programming languages exist; Python is one of them.
- Programming languages are converted to binary numbers (0s and 1s) for the CPU to perform operations.
- Using binary directly is time-consuming for humans; programming languages like Python simplify this.

### Using Python to Program

- **Python**: General-purpose programming language for solving various problems (e.g., building websites, data analysis, automating tasks).
- Python code is converted by an **interpreter** into runnable instructions line by line.

#### Python Versions

- Multiple versions of Python exist; this course uses Python 3.
- Important to track the version used due to syntax differences.
- **Syntax**: Rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language.

### Python in Cybersecurity

- Python is especially useful for **automation** in cybersecurity.
- **Automation**: Reduces human and manual effort for repetitive tasks.

## More about data types

### Definition

- **Data type:**
	- A category for a particular type of data item.

### Data types

#### String

- **Definition**: An ordered sequence of characters.
- **Examples**: 
  - `"updates needed"`
  - `"20%"`
  - `"5.0"`
  - `"35"`
  - `"**/**/**"`
  - `""`
- **Note**: The last item ("") is an empty string.
- **Usage**: Represent text data.

#### List

- **Definition**: A collection of items in sequential form.
- **Examples**: 
  - `[12, 36, 54, 1, 7]`
  - `["eraab", "arusso", "drosas"]`
  - `[True, False, True, True]`
  - `[15, "approved", True, 45.5, False]`
  - `[]`
- **Note**: The last item [] is an empty list.
- **Usage**: Store multiple values in a single variable.

#### Integer

- **Definition**: A whole number without a decimal point.
- **Examples**:
  - `-100`
  - `-12`
  - `-1`
  - `0`
  - `1`
  - `20`
  - `500`
- **Usage**: Represent numerical data without fractions.

### Additional data types

In this course, you will work with the string, list, integer, float, and Boolean data types, but there are other data types. These additional data types include tuple data, dictionary data, and set data.

#### Tuple

- **Definition**: A collection of data that cannot be changed.

## Variables in Python
### What are variables?

- **Definition**: Containers that store data in a programming language.
- **Properties**: Named storage location, can hold values of different data types.
- **Mutability**: Values stored in variables can change.

### Working with variables
#### Assigning and reassigning variables

- Syntax: `variable_name = value`
- Reassigning: Giving a new value to an existing variable.
- Example:
  ```python
	username = "nzhao"
	username = "zhao2"
	```
#### Assigning variables to variables

- Syntax: `variable1 = variable2`
- Example:
	```python
	username = "nzhao"
	old_username = username
	```

#### Putting it together

- Demonstrates updating a username:
	```python
	username = "nzhao"
	old_username = username
	username = "zhao2"
	```

### `type()` function

- **Definition**: Returns the data type of an object.
- **Syntax**: `type(object)`
- **Example**:
	```python
	x = 5
	print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
	```

### Type Error

- **Definition**: An error that results from using the wrong data type.
- **Example**:
	```python
	x = "Hello"
	y = 5
	print(x + y)  # Raises TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
	```

### Best practices for naming variables

- **Syntax rules**:
    - Use letters, numbers, and underscores.
    - Start with a letter or underscore, not a number.
    - Case-sensitive.
    - Avoid using Python keywords.
- **Stylistic guidelines**:
    - Separate words with underscores or capitalize each word except the first.
    - Avoid similar names causing confusion.
    - Keep names descriptive but concise.

### Key takeaways

- Variables store and manipulate data in Python.
- Understanding assignment and reassignment is crucial.
- Following naming conventions improves code readability.

## More on conditionals in Python

### How conditional statements work

- **Conditional statement**: Evaluates code based on specific conditions, resulting in either True or False.
- Common comparison operators for numerical values:

| Operator | Use                        |
|----------|----------------------------|
| >        | greater than               |
| <        | less than                  |
| >=       | greater than or equal to   |
| <=       | less than or equal to      |
| ==       | equal to                   |
| !=       | not equal to               |

#### `if` statements

- Keyword `if` starts a conditional statement.
- Syntax: 
  ```python
	if condition:
		# Body
	```

- The body executes if the condition evaluates to True.

##### `if` statement components

- **Header**: Starts with `if` followed by a condition and ends with a colon.
- **Body**: Code block indented under the header, executed if the condition is True.

### Continuing conditionals with `else` and `elif`

- **`else` statements**:
    - Executes when all preceding conditions in the `if` statement evaluate to False.
    - Syntax:
		```python
		else:
		    # Body
		```

- **`elif` statements**:
	- Used for additional conditions if preceding conditions are False.
	- Syntax:
		```python
		elif condition:
		    # Body
		```

### Logical operators for multiple conditions

- **`and`**: Requires both conditions to be True.
- **`or`**: Requires at least one condition to be True.
- **`not`**: Negates the condition (True becomes False, and vice versa).

#### Examples

- **`and`**:
	```python
	if status > 200 and status < 226:
	    print("successful response")
	```

- **`or`**:
	```python
	if status == 100 or status == 102:
	    print("informational response")
	```

- **`not`**:
	```python
	if not (status >= 200 and status <= 226):
	    print("check status")
	```

### Key takeaways

- Conditional statements are crucial for automating tasks.
- Use `if`, `else`, and `elif` to handle different conditions.
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) enhance conditionals' flexibility.#

## More on loops in Python
### How conditional statements work

- **Iterative statement**: Repeatedly executes a set of instructions based on certain criteria.
- Iterative statements include for loops and while loops.

#### for loops

- Used to iterate through a specified sequence.
- Syntax:
	```python
	for i in sequence:
	    # Body
	```
- `i` is the loop variable, and `sequence` is the sequence to iterate through.

##### Looping through a list

- Easily iterate through lists using for loops.
- Example:
	```python
	computer_assets = ["laptop1", "desktop20", "smartphone03"]
	for asset in computer_assets:
	    print(asset)
	```

##### Using range()

- Generate a sequence of numbers for iterating through a for loop.
- Syntax: `range(start, stop, step)`
- Example:
	```python
	for i in range(0, 5, 1):
	    print(i)
	```

#### while loops

- Used to iterate based on a condition.
- Syntax:
	```python
	while condition:
	    # Body
	```
- Iterates as long as the condition is True.

##### Integers in the loop condition

- Loop condition based on integer values.
- Example:
	```python
	login_attempts = 0
	while login_attempts < 5:
	    print("Login attempts:", login_attempts)
	    login_attempts = login_attempts + 1
	```

##### Boolean values in the loop condition

- Loop condition based on Boolean values.
- Example:
	```python
	count = 0
	login_status = True
	while login_status == True:
	    print("Try again.")
	    count = count + 1
	    if count == 4:
	        login_status = False
	```

### Managing loops
#### break

- Exits a loop based on a condition.
- Example:
	```python
	computer_assets = ["laptop1", "desktop20", "smartphone03"]
	for asset in computer_assets:
	    if asset == "desktop20":
	        break
	    print(asset)
	```

#### continue

- Skips an iteration based on a condition.
- Example:
	```python
	computer_assets = ["laptop1", "desktop20", "smartphone03"]
	for asset in computer_assets:
	    if asset == "desktop20":
	        continue
	    print(asset)
	```

### Infinite loops

- Loops that do not exit.
- Terminate with CTRL-C or CTRL-Z.
- Common in services like web servers.

### Key takeaways

- Security analysts use iterative statements for various tasks.
- for loops iterate through lists or sequences.
- while loops iterate based on conditions.
- break and continue keywords control loop execution.
