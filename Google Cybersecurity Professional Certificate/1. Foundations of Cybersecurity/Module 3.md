# Protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
## Introduction to security frameworks and controls

- Purpose of security framework:
	- Protecting **PII**
	- Securing financial information
	- Identifying security weakness
	- Managing organizational risks
	- Aligning security with business goals

- Components of security framework:
	- Identifying and documenting security goals
	- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
	- Implementing security processes
	- Monitoring and communicating results

## **Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance:**

- **Relationship between Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance:**
  - **CIA Triad:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability principles guide risk considerations in setting up systems and security policies.
  - **Security Controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks, used alongside frameworks to ensure correct security implementation and regulatory compliance.
  - **Security Frameworks:** Guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, including identification of security goals, setting guidelines, implementing processes, and monitoring results.
  - **Compliance:** Adherence to internal standards and external regulations.

- **Specific Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance:**
  - **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** Voluntary compliance framework for managing risk.
  - **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF):** Voluntary framework for managing risks in information systems.
  - **FERC-NERC:** Regulation applicable to organizations involved in the U.S. and North American power grid, ensuring security incident preparedness and mitigation.
  - **FedRAMP:** Federal government program standardizing security assessment, authorization, and monitoring of cloud services.
  - **CIS:** Nonprofit providing controls to safeguard systems and networks against attacks.
  - **GDPR:** European Union regulation protecting EU residents' data privacy.
  - **PCI DSS:** International standard ensuring secure handling of credit card information.
  - **HIPAA:** U.S. federal law protecting patients' health information.
  - **ISO:** International standards for technology, manufacturing, and management.
  - **SOC Type 1 and Type 2:** Reports assessing an organization's financial compliance and risk levels.
  - **Executive Order 14028:** Directs remediation efforts toward federal agencies and third parties with ties to U.S. critical infrastructure.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Understanding controls, frameworks, and compliance helps organizations maintain low risk levels.
  - Security analysts must stay updated on common frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations to ensure organizational and individual safety.

## Ethics in cybersecurity

- Ethical principles in security
	- Confidentiality
	- Privacy protections
	- Laws

---
## **Ethical Concepts in Cybersecurity Decision Making:**

- **Legal Restrictions on Counterattacks:**
  - In the U.S., counterattacks against threat actors are illegal due to laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.
  - Counterattacks can lead to escalation of attacks, especially if the threat actor is state-sponsored or if the counterattack is perceived as vigilantism.
  - Only approved federal government employees or military personnel are allowed to conduct counterattacks in the U.S.
- **International Standards for Counterattacks:**
  - The International Court of Justice (ICJ) allows counterattacks under specific conditions, such as ensuring the attack only affects the initial attacker, does not escalate the situation, and its effects can be reversed.
  - Organizations typically avoid counterattacks due to legal uncertainties and potential negative outcomes.
  - The Tallinn Manual provides updates on international perspectives and ethical concerns related to counterattacks.
- **Ethical Principles and Methodologies:**
  - **Confidentiality:** Ensures only authorized users access specific assets or data, highlighting the need for privacy protection and respect for privacy.
  - **Privacy Protection:** Safeguards personal information from unauthorized use, including personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive PII (SPII), imposing ethical obligations on security professionals to secure private data.
  - **Laws:** Govern rules recognized by a community and enforced by governing entities, requiring security professionals to conduct work honestly, responsibly, and in compliance with the law.
    - Remain unbiased, conduct transparent and evidence-based work, stay informed, and advance skills to contribute to cybersecurity.
  - Example: Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to protect patients' health information (PHI).
  
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Ethics play a crucial role in cybersecurity decision-making, guiding professionals to make correct choices in addressing security threats and breaches.
