## Introduction to the eight CISSP security domains

- **The Eight CISSP Security Domains:**
    1. **Security and Risk Management:**
        - Focuses on establishing and managing security policies, procedures, and guidelines to protect organizational assets and manage risk effectively.
    2. **Asset Security:**
        - Concerned with protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets within an organization, including physical and digital assets.
    3. **Security Architecture and Engineering:**
        - Involves the design, implementation, and management of security controls and architectures to ensure the protection of information assets.
    4. **Communication and Network Security:**
        - Addresses the design, implementation, and management of secure communication channels and networks to protect data transmission.
    5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
        - Focuses on managing user identities and controlling access to resources to ensure only authorized individuals can access information.
    6. **Security Assessment and Testing:**
        - Involves evaluating the effectiveness of security controls, conducting security assessments, and performing penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
    7. **Security Operations:**
        - Covers the day-to-day tasks and activities involved in managing security incidents, monitoring security controls, and responding to security events.
    8. **Software Development Security:**
        - Addresses security considerations and best practices throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure secure coding and application security.

## Understand attackers

- **Threat Actor Types:**
  - **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):**
    - Have significant expertise accessing organizations' networks without authorization.
    - Research their targets in advance and can remain undetected for extended periods.
    - Intentions and motivations include damaging critical infrastructure and gaining access to intellectual property.
  - **Insider Threats:**
    - Abuse authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.
    - Intentions and motivations include sabotage, corruption, espionage, and unauthorized data access or leaks.
  - **Hacktivists:**
    - Driven by a political agenda and use digital technology to accomplish their goals.
    - Intentions and motivations include demonstrations, propaganda, social change campaigns, and fame.
  
- **Hacker Types:**
  - **Authorized Hackers (Ethical Hackers):**
    - Follow a code of ethics and conduct organizational risk evaluations.
    - Motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threats.
  - **Semi-Authorized Hackers (Researchers):**
    - Search for vulnerabilities but donâ€™t exploit them.
  - **Unauthorized Hackers (Unethical Hackers):**
    - Malicious threat actors who do not follow the law.
    - Goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.
  
- **New and Unskilled Threat Actors:**
  - Goals include learning and enhancing hacking skills, seeking revenge, and exploiting security weaknesses.
  
- **Other Types of Hackers:**
  - Consider themselves vigilantes and aim to protect the world from unethical hackers.
  - Some work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Threat actors are defined by malicious intent, while hackers are defined by technical skills and motivations.
