## NIST’s Risk Management Framework

NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF) consists of several steps:

1. **Prepare:**
   - Establishing the context for risk management activities.
   - Determining the organization's risk tolerance.
   - Establishing risk management objectives.

2. **Categorize:**
   - Identifying and categorizing the information systems and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems.
   - Based on the potential impact to the organization's objectives, assets, individuals, operations, and reputation.

3. **Select:**
   - Selecting appropriate security controls and assurance requirements for the information systems.
   - Based on the categorization of those systems.

4. **Implement:**
   - Implementing the selected security controls.
   - Documenting how they are employed within the information systems and environments of operation.

5. **Assess:**
   - Assessing the security controls to ensure they are implemented correctly.
   - Operating as intended.
   - Producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the organization's security requirements.

6. **Authorize:**
   - Authorizing the information system for processing.
   - Based on the security control assessment results and risk determination.

7. **Monitor:**
   - Monitoring the security controls on a continuous basis.
   - Ensuring they continue to be effective in their application.

These steps form a continuous cycle, allowing organizations to manage and adapt to evolving risks effectively.
